# AI Video Captioning Tool

ðŸŽ¥ **Real-time video frame captioning with state-of-the-art vision-language AI**

---

## About

After diving into Reinforcement Learning for a couple of months, I decided to explore something new â€” building an AI-powered video captioning tool! This Flask app extracts frames from uploaded videos, generates captions using a powerful image captioning model, and streams the captions live to the browser.

Ideal for accessibility demos (e.g., smart glasses for the visually impaired) or just exploring vision-language AI in action.

## Features

- Upload a video and extract frames every 2 seconds  
- Batch caption frames with a pretrained BLIP model  
- Stream captions live to the frontend with a sleek dark-themed UI  
- Responsive grid layout with smooth caption animations
